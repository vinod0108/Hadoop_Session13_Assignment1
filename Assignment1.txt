1. What is RDD?
	 RDD’s in Spark are immutable distributed collection of objects.
	They are not actual data, but they are Objects, which contain information about data residing on the cluster	
   
2. Define Partitions.
	spliting of task or processes in to smaller task .smaller task is called as partitions

3. What operations does RDD support?
	RDDs load the data for us and are resilient, which means they can be recomputed.
        RDDs keeps track of Transformations and check them periodically. If a node fails, it can rebuild the lost RDD partition on the other nodes, in parallel
	
4. What do you understand by Transformations in Spark?
	Transformations, which creates a new dataset from the previous RDD and 

5. Define Actions
	Actions, which return a value to the driver program after performing the computation on the dataset.
